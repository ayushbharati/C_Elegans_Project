Class: CS355 – Bioinformatics 
Last Modified: 5/11/2021
Authors: Kent Jones

## Overview
The final project will be presented to the entire class and you may also wish to present your research at other venues (conferences, etc.) in the future, so, doing a good job on this research project can benefit you and your clients! Be sure to invite your client to the presentation! We will record the presentations as well so they can see it if they can't attend.

### 100 pts - Final Analysis and Presentation
***************************************************************

* (10 points)  Title and Overview – A concise overview of your Bioinformatics research project and analysis in proper abstract form
  
    - Title
    - Group Members and Tasks
  
* (10 points) Introduction
  
    - Define your Bioinformatics research topic in a focused, articulate manner
    - Introduce the problems or challenges surrounding this topic and why this is interesting
  
* (10 points) Background Information 
  
    - Overview of background required to understand the problem
    - Describe what other researchers have done to attack this problem (cite your sources) 

* (40 pts) Body of the Analysis
  
    - Present your research and analysis approach 
    - Describe how it is similar or different to what others have done
    - Present analysis findings in the form of graphs, visualizations, data tables as appropriate. Give good titles, label axes, etc. as appropriate
    - Identify future research if appropriate

* (10 points) Conclusions
  
    - Summarize the important findings (positive or negative) of your research project. You are not graded on "getting a positive result"! Learning from approaches that "don't work" is valid!
    - Report your conclusions drawing on the research you have conducted 
    - Demonstrate critical thinking in analysis of outcomes (positive or negative it does not matter) e.g. how do you verify your results? What should biologists investigate next given your research?

* (10 points) Organization Clarity and PowerPoint Presentation

    - Neat and clear organization 
    - Consistent with this outline
    - Clarity of presentation and conclusions

* (10 points) References
  
    - Appropriate use of meaningful references
    - Proper citing and listing on last page of presentation


#### *** NOTES ***

The purpose of project presentation is to evaluate the effectiveness of the final project presentation to the class.   Each presentation should take about 30 minutes and should not exceed 35 minutes. 

* All group members demonstrate professionalism and maintained eye contact with the audience (did not turn their backs on the audience or look down at the floor). Also all spoke loudly and confidently enough for everyone in the room to hear.
